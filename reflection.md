- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
Anna Lee Thompson

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I attended TA hours on Wed Feb 15, but I managed to make a somewhat working code before I received help from a TA, so I left. 

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
Honestly, it's kind of annoying how I have to write out system.out.println isntead of just print() like in Python. It's also annoying that I have to create a variable before I assign it to stuff, which is what I'm used to in r and Python. But in Java if I want to say x = existing_object, I have to first define x. However, it's not too bad. 

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Both languages include while and for loops. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I enjoyed taking breaks between working on it, because if I tried doing it all at once I would have never managed to get to where I am out right now, even if my code right now isn't perfect. Panicking definitely didn't help, which I tend to do a lot even when I try to remind myself to calm down. I also wished I worked more with someone else, because by the time you have both spent hours on the assignment independently, your code is often so different that it's hard to collaborate. 

In addition, once again, I should've started the assignmnet during the weekend.
